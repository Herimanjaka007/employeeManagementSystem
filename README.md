# Employee Management System

## Project Overview

The **Employee Management System** is a Java-based application designed to manage employee data using advanced Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The project focuses on the implementation of Java features such as `Comparator` and `Comparable`, lambda expressions, the `Stream` API, `Collector`, and `Optional`. The system allows for various operations on employee data, including sorting, filtering, grouping, and generating statistical reports.

## Features

- **Employee Management**
  - Create and manage employee data with attributes like `id`, `name`, `department`, `salary`, and `joiningDate`.
  - Implement custom sorting using `Comparable` and multiple `Comparator` implementations.

- **Stream API**
  - Perform complex data processing with streams, including filtering employees based on criteria, grouping by department, and calculating summary statistics.
  - Handle scenarios where certain data may be missing or not found using `Optional`.

- **Collector**
  - Gather data into collections and generate detailed reports on employee statistics, such as total count, average salary, and salary distribution.
